									<h2>Internships</h2>
									<h4>Aimtech Business Solutions Pvt Ltd</h4>
									<p>I had my first internship in the company <a href = "https://aimtechbs.in/"><b>Aimtech Business Solutions private limited</b></a> They are a software selling company who sell a custom made version of a software called Tally.
										Tally is an accounting software which companies use to streamline their transaction management, and tax returns making it an essential part of their daily lives. The ceo Mr Punit Mehta, is not a software engineer, but a chartered
										accountant and his expertise and connections helps him grow his business progressively. I got to learn something outside of the usual coding and I am grateful for it since as a future businessman, 
										learning how to manage one, market one, and invest what you earn back into the company fearlessly again and again, is something you can only understand when you see.

									<h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
									<p> I worked as a Teaching Assistant in Fall 2024, not for a computer science class(where I would just refresh what I already know), but a GEN-ED business management course on scams, frauds, and thefts taught by Samuel Handwerger, an experienced forensic accountant who is loved by all his students at the University Of Maryand.
										Not only just a gen-ed course, but Mr Samuel believed in my capabilities and entrusted me with holding workshops for graduate students as a sophomore! I was to help him with his business communication class 
										where I would listen to the students speeches and guide them in the right direction. I firmly believe in the world, having good commmunication skills takes you very far ahead. This experience gave me confidence to
										converse with those who are more experienced and mature than me, and proved it for me that in this generation, your age doesn't hold a clock to one's knowledge. 
									</p>

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<h4>YouSure?</h4>
									<p>In BitCamp 2024, I participated in a hackathon with a few friends and we worked on a website that takes you health insurances and compares it and tells you which is better? Sounds too familiar? We added more! We made a chatbot
										where you could ask the app to quickly summarize your insurance, highlight anything important which it would recognised as we have trained 
										it to do so!The front end, built with React, offers a user-friendly interface for details, file uploads, and comparisons. The Flask backend supports user login, insurance analysis, and comparisons. Using user data, we predict associated risk with an XGBoost model. PDFs are parsed and stored in a vector database (Pinecone), leveraging RAG with LangChain for tailored results. GPT-3.5 Turbo enhances search functionality, ensuring accurate and up-to-date results.
